        <blockquote> "A week on Kiawah Island during late September was one of the best vacations I had ever had. We stayed in a villa at Windswept. Perfect location as it was only a boardwalk away from the beach and across from Heron Park."  </blockquote>
        
        <p> - Katherine Johnson </p>
        
        
        <blockquote> "This large resort has accommodations for every type of visitor from luxurious rooms at The Sanctuary to villas on the beach and cottages with scenic views. There are areas perfect for families with small children with a swim park and heated pool as well as a playground, as well as areas more suited to couples. There is a camp for children of all ages. Need to teach your child to bike or swim? You're covered! Art classes and crafts! Yes! Of course, the PGA golf courses are amazing, but activities abound for the entire family including spas, tennis, shopping, nature walks, kayaking, bicycle rentals, and delicious places to eat from simple market fare to BBQ to upscale cuisine. Cherrywood BBQ was amazing at Osprey Pointe (try the ham hush puppies)! The resort is very large but offers complimentary transportation with just a call. Our cottage was delightfully decorated and spotlessly clean. The beaches are pristine. This is one of the most relaxing places I've ever stayed and we will be back! I honestly had no complaints. The resort and island are gorgeous. So nice and refreshing to see such a clean, noncommercial, luxurious, laid back vacation spot where I felt safe, comfortable, and relaxed. Truly a southern gem!" </blockquote>

        <blockquote> "Spent a great few days at Kiawah with my daughter and two grandchildren. Our villa in the West Beach area was wonderful! We were on the fourth floor of Shipwatch Villas and saw wonderful sunrises and the full moon in the evening was phenomenal! Villa was spacious and easy access to the beach where we walked each morning and flew kites in the afternoon. Pools at the Heron Park area were heated and the grandchildren had fun in the water park pool. Dinner one night at Jasmine’s Porch in the Sanctuary was up to the exceptional standard of this Resort. Can’t go wrong staying at this resort."</blockquote>
